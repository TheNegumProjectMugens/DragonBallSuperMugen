Note: This character has more than 3 bars of power,
but effectively has only 3.
 If a Special or Super is used with more than 3 bars,
the character's power will reduce to 3 bars, and then
lose the amount of power that they normally would.
 The only scenario where the character will not lose power
is when using power to transform.
