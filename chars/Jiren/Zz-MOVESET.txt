Note: This character has more than 3 bars of power,
but effectively has only 3.
 If a Special or Super is used with more than 3 bars,
the character's power will reduce to 3 bars, and then
lose the amount of power that they normally would.
 The only scenario where the character will not lose power
is when using power to transform.
 This limitation does not apply to Mastered Ultra Instinct,
and it can use all 6 bars of power for Specials and Supers.
